      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This site covers all <strong>23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns</strong> — the foundational
        patterns catalogued by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in their
        seminal 1994 book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every pattern is implemented in <strong>TypeScript</strong> using <strong>NestJS</strong> conventions:
        dependency injection, modules, controllers, and decorators. Each example uses a real-world
        <strong> e-commerce domain</strong> — products, orders, payments, shipping — so the patterns feel
        practical rather than academic.
      </p>

      <h2>How the patterns are organized</h2>
      <p>The 23 patterns are divided into three categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Creational (5 patterns)</strong> — Deal with object creation mechanisms. Includes Singleton,
          Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structural (7 patterns)</strong> — Concern class and object composition. Includes Adapter,
          Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioral (11 patterns)</strong> — Focus on communication between objects. Includes Chain of
          Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy,
          Template Method, and Visitor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What each pattern page includes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem</strong> — A concrete scenario where the pattern is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution</strong> — How the pattern addresses the problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong> — The roles and their responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation</strong> — Full TypeScript source code with syntax highlighting.</li>
        <li><strong>NestJS Integration</strong> — How the pattern maps to NestJS's provider system, DI container, and module architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>When to Use / When NOT to Use</strong> — Practical guidance on applicability.</li>
        <li><strong>Related Patterns</strong> — Cross-references to complementary or alternative patterns.</li>
      </ul>
